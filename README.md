# 🧠 Machine Learning Practicals

This repository contains 12 core machine learning practicals implemented using Python and scikit-learn. Each model demonstrates a fundamental concept in machine learning using real-world datasets from UCI or similar sources.

## 📊 Datasets Used

- Iris Dataset
- Others via UCI / data.gov.in (as applicable)

All datasets used are publicly available and preprocessed if necessary.

## 🧪 Evaluation Techniques

Each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics:

- Train-Test Split
- k-Fold Cross-Validation
- Metrics:
  - Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score
  - Classification: Accuracy, TP, TN, FP, FN, Recall, Specificity, F1-Score, AUC
  - Clustering: Silhouette Score
